Hi! I'm @setacaie. By day I'm learning to be a sysadmin, by night I resurrect busted PCs with superglue and dark magic.

Be warned, my code is bad and will likely make your eyes bleed.

(United States, she/her)

- Not open for work (except maybe side jobs)
- Probably made that last commit from a motherboard taped to a shoe box
- Proficient enough with Windows Server and Linux to make abominable things no-one asked for
- The paragon of recycling old and unwanted tech into things it was never supposed to be
- Usually happy to help... as long as my expertise is applicable to what you're trying to do
- Jack-of-all-trades, master of none

I would be delighted if the trash in my repos is of any use to you.
