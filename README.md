Hi! I'm @setacaie. By day I'm learning to be a sysadmin, by night I resurrect busted PCs with superglue and dark magic.

Be warned, my code is bad and will likely make your eyes bleed.

(United States, she/her)

- Not open for work (at the moment)
- You *really* don't want me contributing to your projects (yet)
- Just enough expertise with Java, Python, and C++ to cause your system to spontaneously combust
- Probably made that last commit from a motherboard taped to a shoe box

Be sure to check out my shovelware repository full of horrible code snippets no-one asked for!
